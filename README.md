# Nukular Fuel

Very simple factorio mod that adds an unbalanced late game fuel for trains. 

## Installation

Either download via the mod management system right in the game (highly recommended) or here: https://mods.factorio.com/mod/NukularFuel

If you download the mod manually you need to put the ".zip" file into the "mods" folder of your factorio installation.
